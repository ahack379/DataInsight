This repository contains a project done during the first few weeks of the Insight Data Science Fellows program.  It also contains the associated web application. Finally, some studying materials for basic CS are included. Directories are described below

ShelfExplorer/ </br> 
Many avid readers have a comfort genre.  Occasionally they want to try something new, but don't have a good way to assess books in genres they're less familiar with.  
This directory contains the main analysis code for Shelf Explorer, a web app that helps users find books outside their comfort genre.


WebApp/ </br>
This directory includes the code needed to run the ShelfExplorer interface locally. Note that the goodreads data set used in this web application is not included in the repository.  To run locally (with the dataset):
> cd WebApp/ </br>
> python run.py

In browser, open localhost:5000

Alternatively, access ShelfExplorer publically by visiting:
www.shelfexplorer.site


Algorithms/ </br>
Basic sorting algorithms written in python for studying time complexity
